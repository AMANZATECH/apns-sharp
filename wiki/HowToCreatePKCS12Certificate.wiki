= Introduction =

This Library is designed to use a PKCS12 format Certificate file, which includes the Private and Public keys in a single container.  This page will show you how to generate this file using the Certificates you downloaded from _iPhone Developer Program Portal_ in either OSX's Keychain or using OpenSSL.


= Details =

==OSX Keychain==
After you've created the appropriate Push Notification Certificate in _iPhone Developer Program Portal_ you should have downloaded a file named something like _apn_developer_identity.cer_.  If you have not done so already, you should open/import this file into Keychain, into your _login_ section.

Finally, if you filter Keychain to show your _login_ container's Certificates, you should see your Certificate listed.  Expand the certificate, and there should be a Key underneath/attached to it.

Right Click or Ctrl+Click on the appropriate Certificate or the Key and choose _Export_.  Keychain will ask you to choose a password to export to.  Pick one and remember it.  You should end up with a _.p12_ file.  You will need this file and the password you picked to use the Notification and Feedback Libraries here.
